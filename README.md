#StupidWebServer

This is a very simple and stupid HTTP server made in JAVA using NetBeans.

Current features are:
- only GET and HEAD methods supported.
- outputs the file present in server's file system as specified in URL.
- takes port number and root directory from command line.
- supports only a few types of HTTP status codes.

Setup:
- duh!
